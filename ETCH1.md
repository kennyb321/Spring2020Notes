# Chapter 1: Creation Managment of Innovation and Technology
## Overview
How do firms create and manage innovation and technology?
<br>This chapter will adress:
* significance of technology, innovation, and their managment
* meaning of technology
* proccess of creating and managing technology
* meaning of innovation
* proccess of creating and managing innovation
* structure of this examination of the creation and managment of technology and innovation

## Importance of Terchnology and Innovation to Business
**root of business today is driven by technology**
<br>
* more than 2 million patents issued in 2011
* technology is going global
	* more foreghn patents issued last year than US patents
* in 2012, the most patents were made in China
* in 2012 the number of lawsuits from patents doubled

**Technology has created better / more standardized pricing**
* ten years ago pricing for goods and services was innefecient
* technology has created a more transparent market place and has helped to standardize and lower prices for goods and services

**inovation of technology has led to more demand and lower prices**

## Wal Mart
* in June 2014, Wal mart introcuded a phone app called **savings catcher**
* **Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)**
	* wal mart uses rfid technology to track what items are being purchased
	* it then uses this information to streamine purchasing
	* allows for more accurate data on what customers are buying and how much they are buying
* in April 2013, wal mart lost **3 billion dollars** do to innefecent stocking and ordering
* according to the university of Arkansas, there was a **16 percent reduction** in out-of-stocks since wal mart implemented **rfid technology**
* items using rfid tech are replinished **3 times faster** than tradtional bar code

## Importance of Innovation and Technology to Society
* In the state of washington, innovation and technology based industrys support 3.55 additional jobs
	* compared to 2.86 jobs in other sectors
* labor incomr in tech based industrys averaged **$61,330** compared to **$32,748** in other industrys
	* **87 percent above average**

**Outsourcing**
* the boom in technology has led jobs to be performed from other parts of the world
* in the US the cost of a computer programmer can be $90,000 a year, the cost of the same quiality work in Russia or India can be half that
* in the next 20 years, 40 million jobs will be lost in the US due to outsourcing made possible by technology

### Technology and Innovation do not Stand Still
* entire industrys can be created and dissapear very quickly due to the creation of new technologys
* example = **record music industry**
	* in the last 50 years, dominant technology has changed from vinyl records, to 8-track tapes, to cassete-tapes, to CD's, to Mp3'same
	* thanks to smart phones, mp3-players are on the way to be obsolute with vinyl and 8track players
* **Kodak**
	* in 2012, Kodak went into bankruptcy because no one was buying cameras anymore,
	* in 213, company restrcutered to by focusing on developing sensors for tablets and smart phones in stead of cameras


## Innovation of Technology Imperitive is Worldwide
* **regulatory Institutions** - laws and regulations in a given country
	* can change from location to location
* **Normative instituions** - norms of the industry and proffessions
	* devloped strong similarites around the world
	* many of the leaders in technology come from same schools, these leaders have taken skills and values taught to them from these schools around the world
* **Cognitive institutions** - those that come from broader spciety and shape an individuals behavior
	* most difficult to change
	* cause greatest difference in behavior from differing parts of the world
	* shaped by culture of a nation
	
## Definition of Innovation and Technology
**inovation** - ongoing proccess of getting an invention to a point where it has an application value of some kind
A few of the major definitions of technology include the following:
* proccesses used r change inputs into outputs
* application of knowledge to perform work
* theoretical ad practcal knowlaedge, skills, and artifacts that can be used toi devleop products as well as their production and delivery system
* techhical means people use to impove thier surroundings
* application of science, especfiallt to industrial or commercial bjectives, the entire body of methods and materials used to achieve such ibjectives

**technology** - *the practical implementation of learning and knowledge by individuals and organizations to aid human endeavor. Technolgy is the knowledge, products, proccesses, tools, and systems used in the creation of goods or in the provission of services*

## Definition of Creation and Managment of Technology
**Innovation Entrepenurship** - *the effective combonation of labor, capital,
and property utilized to create innovative products in keeping
with the changing demans of the market*

**managment of technology is defined as linking engineering, science, and managment disciplines to plan, develop, nd implementationtechnological capabilities to shape and accomplish the strategic 
and operational objectes of an organization**

* **evalutation and control** - monitering technology to ensure that it meets the desired outcomes
* **creation and managment of technology**
	* *the linking and different disciplines to plan, devleop, implement, monitor, and control technological capabilities to shape and accomplish the strategic objectives of an organization*
## Importance of Managing Technology
National Task Force on Technology has listed **five reasons** indiviudals and oragnizations
should be concerned with the managemnt of technology
<ol>
<li>The rapid pace of technological chang demans a cross-discipline approach if economic development is to occer n an effective and efficent manner to take advantage of technoloigical apportunities.</li>
<li>The rapid pace of technological development and the increasing sophtications
of consumers ave shortened product life cycles. The result of these factors]
is a need for organizations to be more proactivw in the managemnt of technology</li>
<li>There is a need to cut product develolpment time as well as to develop more flexibility in organizations.,
The lead-time from idea to market is being reduced by the emergance of new or altered technologys.</li>
<li>Increasing International competition demands that organizations must maximize competivness by effectivly using new technologys</li>
<li>As technology changes, the tools of managment must change, but the proccess of determining what those new tools should be is in its infancy</li>
</ol>

## Key Definitions of Innovation
**Innovation** - *the proccess wherby new and imporved products, proccesses, materials, and services are developed and transferred to a plant and/or
market where they are appropiate*
### Different types of Innovation
* newness of product or proccesses, newness of usage, or combomnation of both
* New Product + Old Usage
	* New Solution to an old problem. Product = medication. Procces = just-in-time
* Old Product + new usage
	* No Innovation
* New product + new usage
	* Most innovative: new product leads to new opportunities.
	* Product: PC in 1980. Proccess: bar codes for inventory control
* old product + new usage:
	* old product / proccess used in a new way
* all these ecamples are **product related**, but there are also innovations that are **service related**
	* **Justin-time (JIT) inventory managment** - proccess innovation that ensures there is exactly as much product needed to meet demand
	
## Creation and Managment of Innovation
Commitment by entrepenur or top managment to innovation requires their recongition of several realties.
The realties are as follows:
<ol>
<li>Managment of Technology encomposses the managment of innovation.</li>
<li> It recquires fostering an environment where innovative thought and work are encouraged</li>
<li>It involves leading a firm from existing proccesses and products to something that is "better" and more valuable</li>
<li>It is proactive and encourages creativity and risk taking</li>
</ol>

**creation and managment of innovation** - *a comprehensive appraoch to managerial problem solving action based on an integrative problem solving
frameowkr, and and understanding of the linkages among innovation streams, organizational teams,
and organizational evolution. It is about implementation, managing politics, control, and individual resistance to change. 
The manager is an architect/ engineer, politicion/network builder, and artists/scientist.*
